here are all of the files in OlympiaShellCollection.f3d as individual STL files ready to be ordered and printed!
everything was exported using high refinement settings and a Normal Deviation of 3.000

keep in mind, this set does not include anything from the parametric notch builder, as that is a custom notch profile that you have to make yourself. maybe one day i will make a seperate folder that has a bunch of really nice presets made using the notch builder tool. but for now, if you want to use the notch builder, you must modify the parameters to your liking and then export it as an STL.
