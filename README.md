Go to "3D/CNC" and then drag and drop your STLs into the "Add 3D Files" box of the "3D Printing" section

You can do multiple files at once! (Up to 10)

Once your files are finished uploading, select the type of 3D Technology and Material you want

My personal favorite for the shells currently is SLA(Resin) and Imagine Black with the default surface finish (sanding, general sanding)

Lastly, "Secure Checkout" and put in your payment information! Shipping can be a lot, be prepared for that.
